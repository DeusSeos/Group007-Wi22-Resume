Numerous weather-related accidents have been documented over the last decade.<sup>1</sup> The data collected shows that 21% of these crashes are due to weather conditions. \n",

These are aspects that will not pertain to our research and we will take precautions in the case that our founded datasets will have this kind of information.\n",

    "We also foresee any stereotypical driving troupes that may be discriminatory against race and gender. Since our data will be centered around Northern and Southern Californians, we do not believe there will be any bias that may invalidate the data sets that we are working with. Much of the data sets that we are working with aren't directed towards a certain social group of any kind and we are solely utilizing the quantitative data to aid our data science research. Our findings and conclusions will be used to justify the concerns of driving during weather-based conditions, specifically under precipitation in areas where the population is not used to such road conditions."
