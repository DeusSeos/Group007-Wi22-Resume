    "*The level of precipitation has been associated with the number of car accidents that occur during the inclement weather events. This is especially so when it occurs in locations that have climates that are generally hot and dry. For our project, we are working to determine and analyze how much precipitation can affect driving and the number of car accidents in dry climate locations. We will analyze our data sets through scatterplots, bar graphs, and line plots to see the correlation between the level of precipitation and the rate of car accidents. In addition to these variables, we will also take into consideration the specific day of the week and the month as our confounding variables. After our complete analysis, we concluded that there is a slight relationship between precipitation and car accidents in specific cities, but this relationship doesnâ€™t reflect all the dry climate cities due to the day of the week and the month.*"
